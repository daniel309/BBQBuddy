    /* The colon/apostrophe handling needs some further explanation:
     *
     * colonSegPin is the segment pin for colon. I.e. some displays have a separate segment for colon on one of the digits.
     * others have colon split across two digits: i.e. the upper part has a separate segment on one digit, whereas the lower
     * part has uses the same segment pin but on another digit. It is assumed that this segment pin is only used for colon,
     * and it is stored into colonSegPin by setColonPin(int). The functions setColon() and clearColon() turns on/off this pin,
     * respectively.
     *
     * On some displays, colon is one or two separate free-standing LED(s) with its own cathode and anode. In case of common
     * cathode, ground the cathod and treat the anode(s) as a segment pin. The other way around in case of common anode. This
     * should make the method described above applicable.
     *
     * On other displays, the upper colon part, the lower colon part, as well as an apostrophe, shares segments with the usual
     * segments (i.e. segments A, B and C) but is treated as a separate symbol digit that must be multiplexed along with the
     * other digits. In this case the function setSymbPins(int,int,int,int) is used to assign a pin to that digit, stored in
     * symbDigPin. The pin corresponding to the upper colon segment is stored in colonSegPin, whereas the lower colon segment
     * is stored in colonSegLPin. aposSegPin holds the segment pin for the apostrophe. symbDigPin being unequal to -1 is an
     * indication for multiplexing-related functions that it must multiplex over _numOfDigits+1 digit pins. In this case, the
     * setColon(), clearColon(), setApos() and clearApos() does not directly influence the pin, but the variable colonState and
     * aposState. In this case, the digit must be changed to the symbol digit by issuing changeDigit('s') in order to show the
     * symbols.
